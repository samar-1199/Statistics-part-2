        "-  It is a claim or a statement or assumption about population parameter that can be tested using statistical method.\n",
        "-  You made a claim about the population (say the average age is 45 years).\n",

        "**Q2.** What is the null hypothesis, and how does it differ from the alternative hypothesis?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The null hypothesis is a kind of hypothesis which explains the population parameter whose purpose is to test the validity of the given experimental data.  In other words, the null hypothesis is a hypothesis in which the sample observations results from the chance.\n",
        "- Null hypothesis implies a statement that expects no difference or effect. On the contrary, an alternative hypothesis is one that expects some difference or effect.\n",

        "**Q3.**What is the significance level in hypothesis testing, and why is it important?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Significance levels in statistics are a crucial component of hypothesis testing. However, unlike other values in your statistical output, the significance level is not something that statistical software calculates. Instead, you choose the significance level.\n",

        "**Q4.**What does a P-value represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "- The p value is a number, calculated from a statistical test, that describes how likely you are to have found a particular set of observations if the null hypothesis were true.\n",
        "\n",
        "P values are used in hypothesis testing to help decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. The smaller the p value, the more likely you are to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q5.**How do you interpret the P-value in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "- To interpret the p-value, you need to compare it to a chosen significance level(α) . During hypothesis testing, we assume a significance level (α), generally 5% (α = 0.05). It is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. It is observed that lower the p-value, higher is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis.\n",

For checking the relationship between variables in a single direction (Left or Right direction), we use a one-tailed test. A two-tailed test is used to check whether the relations between variables are in any direction or not.\n",

        "**Q8.**What is the Z-test, and when is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  A Z-test is a type of hypothesis test that compares the sample’s average to the population’s average and calculates the Z-score and tells us how much the sample average is different from the population average by looking at how much the data normally varies. It is particularly useful when the sample size is large >30. This Z-Score is also known as Z-Statistics formula.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q9.** How do you calculate the Z-score, and what does it represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Z-Score in statistics is a measurement of how many standard deviations away a data point is from the mean of a distribution. A z-score of 0 indicates that the data point’s score is the same as the mean score. A positive z-score indicates that the data point is above average, while a negative z-score indicates that the data point is below average.\n",

        "\n",
        "-  The t -distribution is used when data are approximately normally distributed, which means the data follow a bell shape but the population variance is unknown. The variance in a t -distribution is estimated based on the degrees of freedom of the data set (total number of observations minus 1).\n",

The Z-test is based on the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution).\n",
        "\n",
        "- T-test:T-test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.It is particularly useful when the sample size is small (typically n < 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown. The T-test relies on the t-distribution, which is similar to the normal distribution but has heavier tails.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q12.**What is the T-test, and how is it used in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "-  T-Test is a method used in statistics to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups and how they are related. In T-Test statistics, the sample data is a subset of the two groups that we use to draw conclusions about the groups as a whole.\n",

        "\n",
        "-  The Z-test and T-test are both valuable tools for comparing population means, with the Z-test suited for large samples with known standard deviations, and the T-test for smaller samples with unknown deviations. Their applications vary based on sample size and data characteristics.\n",

        "**Q14.**What is a confidence interval, and how is it used to interpret statistical results?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Confidence Interval (CI) is a range of values that estimates where the true population value is likely to fall. Instead of just saying The average height of students is 165 cm a confidence interval allow us to say We are 95% confident that the true average height is between 160 cm and 170 cm.\n",

        "\n",
        "- A chi-square (Χ 2) goodness of fit test is a goodness of fit test for a categorical variable. Goodness of fit is a measure of how well a statistical model fits a set of observations. When goodness of fit is high, the values expected based on the model are close to the observed values.\n",
